Problem Statement:
Supply Chain Optimisation focuses on improving the efficiency of product flow from suppliers to customers. In this project, we analyse sales and inventory data to improve demand forecasting and optimise stock levels. The goal is to reduce costs and ensure smooth operations. By using data-driven insights, we help the business make smarter supply chain decisions.
